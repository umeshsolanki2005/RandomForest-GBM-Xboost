# RandomForest-GBM-Xboost
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (GBM), and XGBoost are powerful ensemble learning techniques used for classification and regression tasks.
* Random Forest is an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions through majority voting (for classification) or averaging (for regression). It reduces overfitting and improves accuracy by training each tree on a random subset of the data.
* Gradient Boosting (GBM) is a sequential ensemble method that builds decision trees iteratively, with each new tree correcting the errors of the previous ones. It minimizes the loss function and improves performance over time, making it effective for complex datasets.
* XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) is an optimized version of GBM that improves training speed and accuracy using advanced regularization techniques and parallel processing. It is widely used in machine learning competitions due to its efficiency and predictive power.
